  <h1>Unframed</h1>
  <p>Unframed is a tool to help protect your site from people stealing your content with iframes. You can also embed another page on your site without it being blocked, if that's something you do.</p> <br>
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <h6>• Unintrusive</h6>
  <p>Doesn't interfere with any current scripts that you have on your site, or your site content.
  
  <h6>• Simple to setup</h6>
  <p>Unframed only takes one line of HTML to setup - you don't need to configure any files to get up and running.</p>
  <h6>• Same-domain embeds won't be blocked</h6>
  <p>You can still embed other pages from your site without getting blocked.</p>
  
  <br>
  
  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>Install Unframed by inserting this script tag at the very bottom of your page:</p><br>
  <code>
    &#60;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/proudparrot2/unframed/script.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;
  </code>
  

  <br><br>
  
  <h3 id="updating">Updating</h3>
  <p>Updating Unframed is extremely easy - you don't have to do anything! Compared to other competitors, like Unbed, updates are automatically applied when they are released. Support to revert to older versions will be added soon.</p>

  <br>

  
  <h3>Demo</h3>
  <p>This is an example of when you try to embed a blocked page:</p>
  <iframe height="300" width="600" src="demo.html"></iframe>
  <p>This embed has been changed to always be blocked, even though it's in the same domain. This will change if you are trying to do something like this.</p>
