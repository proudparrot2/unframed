  <h1>Unframed <span class="badge">BETA</span></h1>
  <p>Unframed is the all-in-one solution to stop your site from being embedded, and stop people stealing your content.</p> <br>
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <p>Here some features of Unframed:</p>
  <h6>• Unintrusive</h6>
  <p>Doesn't interfere with any current scripts that you have on your site, or your site content.
  
  <h6>• Simple to setup</h6>
  <p>Unframed only takes one line of HTML to setup - you don't need to configure any files to get up and running.</p>
  
  <h6>• Support for same-domain embeds</h6>
  <p>You can still embed other pages from your site without getting blocked.</p>

  <h6>• Support for alternate links</h6>
  <p>If you have a situation where you distribute multiple links of your website, Unframed will have no problem handling them.</p>
  
  <br>

  <h3>Demo</h3>
  <p>This is an example of when you try to embed a blocked page:</p>
  <iframe height="300" width="600" src="demo.html"></iframe>
  <p>This embed is designed to always be blocked for demonstration purposes - same-origin embeds will still work as normal.</p>

  <br>

  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>Install Unframed by inserting this script tag at the very bottom of your page:</p><br>
  <code>
    &#60;script src="https://unframed.netlify.app/latest.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;
  </code>
  

  <br><br>
