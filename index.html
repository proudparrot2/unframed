  <h1>Unframed</h1>
  <p>Unframed is the all-in-one solution to stop your site from being embedded, and stop people stealing your content.</p> <br>
  <h3>Features</h3>
  <h6>• Unintrusive</h6>
  <p>Doesn't interfere with any current scripts that you have on your site, or your site content.
  
  <h6>• Simple to setup</h6>
  <p>Unframed only takes one line of HTML to setup - you don't need to configure any files to get up and running.</p>
  
  <h6>• Supports same-domain embeds</h6>
  <p>You can still embed other pages from your site without getting blocked.</p>

  <h6>• Use multiple links and about:blank</h6>
  <p>If you have a situation where you distribute multiple links of your website, Unframed will have no problem handling them - unlike Unbed, in which you have to manually insert each link. It also supports about:blank pages!</p>
  
  <br>
  
  <h3>Installation</h3>
  <p>Install Unframed by inserting this script tag at the very bottom of your page:</p><br>
  <code>
    &#60;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/proudparrot2/unframed/latest.js"&#62;&#60;/script&#62;
  </code>
  

  <br><br>
  
  <h3 id="updating">Updating</h3>
  <p>Updating Unframed is extremely easy - you don't have to do anything! Compared to other competitors, like Unbed, updates are automatically applied when they are released. Support to revert to older versions will be added soon.</p>

  <br>

  
  <h3>Demo</h3>
  <p>This is an example of when you try to embed a blocked page:</p>
  <iframe height="300" width="600" src="demo.html"></iframe>
  <p>This embed has been changed to always be blocked, even though it's in the same domain. This will change if you are trying to do something like this.</p>
