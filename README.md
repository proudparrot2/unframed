# Unframed
Unframed is a tool to help protect your site from people stealing your content with iframes. You can also embed another page on your site without it being blocked, if that's something you do

### Features
* Unintrusive
* Simple to setup
* Same-domain embeds won't be blocked

### Installation
Install Unframed by inserting this script tag at the very bottom of your page:
```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/proudparrot2/unframed/script.js"></script>
```
